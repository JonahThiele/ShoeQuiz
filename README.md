# CSC310_final

## ShoeSeeker
Advanced Data structures project to select a perfect running shoe for the a user across brands for certain running experience

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
This program uses crow, inja, c++, html, css, and some basic javascript

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
1.  complete the basic outline of the quiz in inja
2.  Store the shoe data as a hashmap on the server side 
3.  check if the user wants to have a shoe that is
