## ShoeSeeker
Advanced Data structures project to select a perfect running shoe for the a user across brands for certain running experience

## Installation
This program uses crow, inja, c++, html, css, and some basic javascript

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Next Steps
1. allow the user to select a current shoe they are using and what they like and dislike with that
